# Python-Challenge
 Week 3 Challenge - Python
 
 In this week's assignment I was able to work inside Visual Code creating Python files and scripts.
 The Challenge has two exercises. 
 1- Budget Analysis where I create a script that analyzes the records of a company showing: 
                   The total number of months included in the dataset
                   The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
                   The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
                   The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
                   The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

2- Pool Election where I could create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
                   The total number of votes cast
                   A complete list of candidates who received votes
                   The percentage of votes each candidate won
                   The total number of votes each candidate won
                   The winner of the election based on popular vote
